    " - Notice that using TFIDF word presentation, you were able to build a better model by just using 4000 words as oppossed to the 29,192 words of the BOW. \n",
    " - This is where TFIDF's strength lies which gives the intution that rest of the 25,000+ words weren't adding much useful information to the model and would be common among many documents.\n",
    " - You can know more about the word vectors, TFIDF and similar text embeddings in [this comprehensive article](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/word-embeddings-count-word2veec/).\n",
    " - Finally, note that you could have gotten an even better accuracy by doing preprocessing over the text like Normalization, spelling correction and much more."
